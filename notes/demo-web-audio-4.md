# Web Audio IV - *Audio Concepts Review*

## I. Overview
- Let's review some of the slides from the IIM aufio lecture:
  - [IGME-110 - Week-11a-Audio-Lecture.pdf](./_files/Week-11a-Audio-Lecture.pdf)
- We are also going to take going to take a look at Chapter 1 - *Fundamentals* of this online book -  *Web Audio API: Advanced Sound for Games and Interactive Apps*
  - https://webaudioapi.com/book/Web_Audio_API_Boris_Smus_html/toc.html
  - [Web Audio Study Guide - Chapter 1 - *Fundamentals*](./web-audio-chapter-1.md)


## II. IIM Slides

- Slides #3-#5
  - Sound waves are variations of pressure in a *medium* such as air
  - Typical waveform graphs are two-dimensional, but in the real world sound waves are three-dimensional. Waveform graphs usually visualize a sound wave progressing up and down from from left to right, but real sound waves travel in an expanding sphere from the source.
  - High amplitude values represent areas of increased air pressure. 
  - The end result of manipulating sounds is a series of high and low pressure zones

- Slides #6 - #13
  - Starting with Thomas Edison's demonstration of the first phonograph in 1877, it has been possible to capture sound pressure waves onto a physical medium (Phonographic record, tape, etc) and then reproduce the sound later by reproducing the same pressure waves - this is called *analog* recording
  -  Analog recording suffers from the problem of *noise*. Each time an analog recording is copied, more noise is introduced, decreasing the accurancy of the reprodution (fidelity)
  - *Digital recording* works by sampling the audio wave at evenly-spaced timepoints, and then representing each sample as a discrete number. These can be copied perfectly without introducing any additional noise
