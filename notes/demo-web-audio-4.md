## II. IIM Slides

- Slides #3-#5
  - Sound waves are variations of pressure in a *medium* such as air
  - Typical waveform graphs are two-dimensional, but in the real world sound waves are three-dimensional. Waveform graphs usually visualize a sound wave progressing up and down from from left to right, but real sound waves travel in an expanding sphere from the source.
  - High amplitude values represent areas of increased air pressure. 
  - The end result of manipulating sounds is a series of high and low pressure zones
