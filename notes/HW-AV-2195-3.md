## II. XXX

1)  Make a copy of the main project folder (and all of the files/folders that are in it) from Part II, and name this one **web-audio-hw-3**

<hr>

2) Here's the comments you'll need - add these to the bottom of `draw()` in **canvas.js**

```js
// 6 - bitmap manipulation
	// TODO: right now. we are looping though every pixel of the canvas, regardless of whether 
	// or not we are applying a pixel effect
	// At some point, refactor this code so that we are looping though the image data only if
	// it is necessary

	// A) grab all of the pixels on the canvas and put them in the `data` array
	// 
	
	// B) Iterate through each pixel, stepping 4 elements at a time (which is the RGBA for 1 pixel)

		// C) randomly change every 20th pixel to red
	
			// data[i] is the red channel
			// data[i+1] is the green channel
			// data[i+2] is the blue channel
			// data[i+3] is the alpha channel
			// zero out the red and green and blue channels
			// make the red channel 100% red
		} // end if
	} // end for
	
	// D) copy image data back to canvas
```

3) Now type it in yourself
